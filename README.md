## "...An Epic for the Ages!"

IT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE THINKING!
Zelda II + Mario + The Lord of the Rings = Epicness!
A game made in ONE MONTH for the **YOMAJAM 2021 GAME JAM.**

Re-experience the magical adventure of Frodo and his friends on this parody retelling of Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring in the style of the classic Super Mario Bros. and Zelda games with the funny humor of Serious Sam.
Beat up evil Orcs, Goblins, Ringwraiths and jump through countless spikes, falling bridges in the fantastical land of Middle-Earth in a retro aesthetic. Meet Sam, Gandalf, Aragorn and Legolas in byte-sized pixel forms while running away from Sauron's red dark lord eyes.

## Important Information!

**Controls: Arrow Keys (Movement) - A (Jump) - S (Attack)**
